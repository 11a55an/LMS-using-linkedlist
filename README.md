## Introduction

The Library Management System (LMS) is a C++ application that manages a library's collection of books using a linked list data structure. The system employs OOP principles for design, file handling for persistence, and exceptional handling for error management.

## Features

- **Linked List Implementation**: Utilizes a linked list data structure to manage the books efficiently.
- **File Handling**: Stores book data persistently using file handling techniques.
- **OOP Concepts**: Demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts for modularity and reusability.
- **Data Structures**: Uses data structures, particularly linked lists, to organize and manage book information.
- **Exceptional Handling**: Implements error handling mechanisms to enhance the application's robustness.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any C++ IDE)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/11a55an/LMS-using-linkedlist
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.

3. Compile the C++ code.

4. Run the executable generated after compilation.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the Library Management System.
